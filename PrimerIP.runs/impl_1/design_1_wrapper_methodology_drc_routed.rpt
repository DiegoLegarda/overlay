There is a large setup violation of -9.714 ns between design_1_i/HOGv22_0/U0/uut/hog_cell_histogram_inst/cell_idx_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/HOGv22_0/U0/uut/hog_cell_histogram_inst/Histograma_fifo_reg[0][6][13]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
